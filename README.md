# games-pythonista-beehive
A repository for the mobile game BeeHive developed for the iPhone in Pythonista.

In this game you play as the character of a bee, trying to collect honey while avoiding the enemy bees and collecting power ups on the way. You move the bee with the iPhone's built-in accelerometer and gyroscope. 

The code still needs a facelift and is lacking in consistent comments. This will be fixed in the near future.
